# zoomer - Bot library for Zoom meetings

Good bot support is part of what makes Discord so nice to use.  Unfortunately, the official Zoom API is basically only useful for scheduling meetings and using Zoom Chat, not for making [in-meeting](https://devforum.zoom.us/t/in-meeting-chat-api/39948/4) bots.  So I decided to bring this feature to Zoom myself.

Here is a demo of a basic, ~130 lines of code bot:

## WEB SDK

I created this by reverse engineering the Zoom Web SDK.  Regular web joins are captcha-gated but web SDK joins [are not](https://devforum.zoom.us/t/remove-recaptcha-on-webinars-websdk1-7-9/23054/25).  I use an API only used by the Web SDK to get tokens needed to join the meeting.  This means you need a Zoom API key/secret, specifically a JWT one.  These can be obtained on the Zoom [App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build) site.  The demo at `cmd/zoomer/main.go` reads these from the environment as `ZOOM_JWT_API_KEY` and `ZOOM_JWT_API_SECRET`.

### NOTE
Because the API keys are associated with your account, using this software may get your Zoom account banned (reverse engineering is against the Zoom Terms of Service).  Please do not use this on an important account.


## PLAY WITH DEMO

```
$ go get github.com/chris124567/zoomer
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/chris124567/zoomer
$ scripts/build.sh
$ ZOOM_JWT_API_KEY="xxx" ZOOM_JWT_API_SECRET="xxx" ./zoomer -meetingNumber xxxxx -password xxxxx
```

Feel free to use the demo as a template.  If you want to use the library elsewhere just import `github.com/chris124567/zoomer/pkg/zoom`.

### DEMO WALKTHROUGH

Note that you are free to construct your own message types for any I have not implemented.

For sending: Look at `zoom/requests.go` and switch out the struct and message type names for your new message type

For receiving: Create a definition for the type and update the getPointerForBody function in `zoom/message.go.`

## INFORMATION ON PROTOCOL
The protocol used by the Zoom Web client is basically just JSON over Websockets.  The messages look something like this:

```
{"body":{"bCanUnmuteVideo":true},"evt":7938,"seq":44}
{"body":{"add":null,"remove":null,"update":[{"audio":"","bAudioUnencrytped":false,"id":16785408}]},"evt":7937,"seq":47}
{"body":{"add":null,"remove":null,"update":[{"caps":5,"id":16785408,"muted":true}]},"evt":7937,"seq":63}
{"body":{"dc":"the United States(SC)","network":"Zoom Global Network","region":"the United States"},"evt":7954,"seq":3}
```

The "evt" number specifies the event number.  There is a (mostly complete) list of these in `zoom/constant.go` that I extracted from javascript code on the meeting page.

For the above three messages, the types are:
```
WS_CONF_ATTRIBUTE_INDICATION                     = 7938 // ConferenceAttributeIndication
WS_CONF_ROSTER_INDICATION                        = 7937 // ConferenceRosterIndication
WS_CONF_DC_REGION_INDICATION                     = 7954 // ConferenceDCRegionIndication
```
The thing in the comments to the right is the struct type for that message, which can be found in `zoom/message_types.go`.

Also, the server and client both have sequence numbers ("seq") for the messages they send but it doesn't appear to be used for anything (?).

## TODO (DESCENDING ORDER OF PRIORITY)
- Gracefully exit/disconnect
- Organize `zoom/message_types.go` and general refactoring
- Support for meetings where you don't have the password but just a Zoom url with the "pwd" parameter in it (anyone know anything about this??)
- Thoroughly test things
- Make it more extensible
- Joining breakout room support
- More comments and documentation
- Support audio/video - partial support for decrypting screen share is added.
